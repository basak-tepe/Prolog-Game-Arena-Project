1)Familiarize yourself with the game mechanics and the provided code by reading through the files 
main.pro, simulator.pro, agent.pro, and solution.pro.
2)Understand the requirements for each of the predicates that you are supposed to implement. 
Read through each of the requirements carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.
3)Write a plan for how you are going to implement each of the predicates. 
Consider the inputs, outputs, and logic that each predicate will need.
4)Begin implementing the predicates one by one, starting with the easiest one. 
You can test each predicate as you go by loading the main.pro file and running test queries in the SWI-Prolog terminal.
5)Once you have implemented all the predicates, 
test your implementation thoroughly by running various scenarios using the provided scenes.
6)If you encounter any issues, debug your code by using print statements or by running the SWI-Prolog debugger.
7)Once you are confident that your implementation is correct, submit your code.
